SonarQube Rencore XML Plugin
============================

Install this if you don't already have a plugin which covers XML in your SonarQube install.

SonarQube can only contain one language definition plugin at a time, so the SPCAF plugin is separated to allow for this.

Example conflicting plugins:
XML

Do not install this plugin if you have either this or another plugin that already defines the language. Your SPCAF rules will be added to that rule repository automatically.
