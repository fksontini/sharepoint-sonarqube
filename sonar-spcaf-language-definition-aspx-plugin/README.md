SonarQube Rencore ASPX Plugin
=============================

Install this if you don't already have a plugin which covers ASPX in your SonarQube install.

SonarQube can only contain one language definition plugin at a time, so the SPCAF plugin is separated to allow for this.

Example conflicting plugins:
Unknown at this time

Do not install this plugin if you have any plugin that already defines the language. Your SPCAF rules will be added to that rule repository automatically.
